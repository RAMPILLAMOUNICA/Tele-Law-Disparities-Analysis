# Tele-Law Case Disparities â€“ Data Analysis Project

 ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
**Analyzing Demographic and Regional Disparities in Tele-Law Case Registrations for Inclusive Legal Access**

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze disparities in Tele-Law case registrations across different regions and demographics in India. Using machine learning models on real-world Tele-Law case data, we identify patterns and gaps in legal access and suggest improvements.

Platform Used: IBM Watsonx.ai
Domain: Law, Social Good, Machine Learning
Dataset: Tele-Law case registration data (from dashboard.tele-law.in)


ðŸ’» Tech Stack
Language: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
Platform: IBM Watsonx.ai Studio
Libraries: 
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: [dashboard.tele-law.in](https://dashboard.tele-law.in/)
Description: Includes data on Tele-Law case counts by region, gender, age group, and month/year.



ðŸ§  Approach
1. Data Collection â€“ Downloaded data from official Tele-Law portal.
2. Data Cleaning â€“ Handled missing values, normalized categories.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized regional and demographic disparities.
4. Modeling â€“ Applied classification and regression ML models to predict trends.
5. Evaluation â€“ Assessed models with accuracy, confusion matrix, and validation metrics.

ðŸ“½ Presentation
The project presentation (`TeleLaw_Project_PPT.pptx`) is available.

 ðŸ§¾ Conclusion
Our findings reveal key disparities in legal service access. Urban regions and males are overrepresented in registrations. This project highlights the importance of data-driven policymaking in achieving inclusive legal access (aligned with SDG 16).
